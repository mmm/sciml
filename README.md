# Scientific ML/AI

Shall we call it "Scientific ML" or "Physics-informed machine learning?"  I think
PINN is a subset, so let's stick with SciML.

## Project notes

we'll start with examples.


# Common SciML approaches to solving problems

## Surrogates

Totally take out the physics with a NN approximation.

Domains:

- EDA
- MD
- Fluids

## Inverse

- MD
- Fluids

## ML-driven

- EDA
- "faster monte-carlo"

## Hybrid

- Fluids

## Other?

- is there a better term for our "Physics-informed DRL?"
  I.e., this is bigger and more complex than PINN
  but _also_ perhaps closer to the problem domain?


# Worked examples

WIP

# Target audience

Potential learners:

- Researchers: know the science, new to deep learning
- Data Scientists: know the ML, new to the science
- Undergrads: new to both
